Earlier test runs used DataWarrior as native installation for Linux,
updated by Tuesday, September 7th, 2021.  After backing up the .jar
in /opt/datawarrior into a separate folder, the currently (Sunday,
September 19th) available .jar on 

  https://github.com/thsa/datawarrior/tree/master/lib

were fetched to overwrite the more senior files.  This intends to
account for all changes in DW's executable by Thomas since reporting
the issue.  The limited test with a new library of drug-like molecules
(n = 250) to assign InChI by DataWarrior and the subsequent comparison
with InChI trust's reference implementation suggest Thomas' work is
ongoing.
