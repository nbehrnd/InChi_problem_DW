* Motivation

  The disagreement between OpenBabel and RDKit on one hand, and DataWarrior on
  the other hand, about the InChiKeys assigned to the structures need not be a
  disagreement on the level where these are hashed from the intermediate InChi.
  Instead, there already could be differences assigning the InChi.  A previous
  run with a set with 250 molecules could be to small to provide a reasonable
  picture.

  Again, the Python interface to OpenBabel (version 3.1.1, as provided in the
  repositories of Debian 12/bookworm, branch testing) is used for an inspection.
  Scripts used are written for and used from the CLI of standard CPython
  (version 3.9.2 as installed from Debian's repositories).
  
* Test run (n = 1k), OpenBabel

** preparation 

   With DataWarrior's default settings, a random library of 1000 molecules was
   generated (file =Random_Molecules_1000.dwar=).  These were exported directly
   into a structure file (file =Random_Molecules_1000.sdf=).

   Script =obabel_inchi.py= was used to read DataWarrior's =.sdf= to count the
   chiral atoms, double bonds unrelated to cycles and to assign SMILES, InChi,
   and InChiKeys.  The script wrote file =analysis.txt= as permanent record with
   column headers obstereo, obEZ, obSMILES, obInChi, and obInChiKey
   respectively.  To ease interaction with DataWarrior, the tables were
   separated by tabulators.

   The content of file =analysis.txt= was pasted into a pristine running
   instance of DataWarrior including the header line.  DataWarrior macro
   =ob_dw_check.dwam= was imported and run to
   + assign SMILES, Inchi, and InChiKey by DataWarrior based on OpenBabel's
     SMILES
   + to compare e.g., obSMILES (SMILES by OpenBabel) with dwSMILES (SMILES by
     DW) as strings.  The Boolean relation =str(obSMILES) == str(dwSMILES)=
     either yields =1= (one) if these strings match each other, or =0= (zero) if
     the strings compared with each other are different.
   The results were saved in file =Random_Molecules_1000_check.dwar=.  The sort
   of the entries (e.g., number of stereogenic centers (=obstereo=) as first,
   the number of exocyclic double bonds (=obEZ=) as second criterion), again
   supports the hypothesis of identical InChi assigned by OpenBabel and DW for
   all compounds lacking a stereogenic center and an exocyclic double bond.

   Note the advantage of this .dwar file to narrow down interactively the
   molecules of interest with the slide rules (e.g., number of double bonds,
   chiral centers, level of the Boolean comparisons).

   It equally is possible to sort the entries for similarity/dissimilarity of
   the SMILES strings (column =diff_smiles=).  Since the same structure may be
   expressed differently (e.g., =c1ccncc1= and =c1ccccn1= both about pyridine),
   this criterion however is not pursued further.

   The content of =Random_Molecules_1000_check.dwar= was exported as text (File
   -> Save Special -> Textfile) as file =Random_Molecules_1000_check.txt=.
   Python script =table_stat.py= was used to group the molecules by number of
   stereogenic centers, number of exocyclic double bonds and if the strings of
   the InChi assigned by OpenBabel and DW match (=1=) or not (=0=).  With file
   =frequency_List.txt=, the script generated a permanent record.

   This frequency count is the basis for the following table.

** Conclusion

   Except for molecules lacking stereogenic centers and exocyclic double bonds,
   apparently, there are differences in the assignment of InChi by current
   OpenBabel (version 3.1.1) and DataWarrior (development version for Mac/Linux,
   fetched by <2021-09-07 Tue>).

   The limited compilation is interpreted as if the presence of exocyclic double
   bonds were of stronger influence than the presence of chiral centers to
   reduce the probability of a matching InChi by both generators.

  This test departed from a random library of 5000 molecules deposit in file
  =Random_Molecules_5k.dwar=.  The data were processed as in the previous test

     The InChi assigned by DataWarrior and OpenBabel match each other for all of
     1864 molecules lacking a stereogenic center and exocyclic double bond.  For
     molecules belonging to any other class, the propability that the two
     generators assign different InChi (and consequently, a different InChiKey)
     is considerably larger.

* Test run, (n = 1k), RDKit

  For the purpose of comparison, the scrutiny was repeated with the currently
  available version of RDKit (2021.03.5) packaged by Miniconda.  This approach
  was elected because this one is multiple releases ahead of the latest version
  (2020.09.5) currently packaged for Linux Debian 12/bookworm (branch testing).
  The approach aims to follow closely the previous analysis with OpenBabel.

  The same library, the same .sdf generated by DW about 1k drug like molecules
  was read by script =rdkit_inchi.py= to assign by RDKit SMILES, InChI, and
  InChIKey to yield intermediate file =RDKit_analysis.txt=.  The content of the
  later was pasted (including the header line) into DW.  DW converted RDKit's
  SMILES into structures.  Macro =rd_dw_check.dwam= was used to let DW assign
  SMILES, InChI, and InChiKey; the comparison of the strings equally was driven
  by this macro.  To retain interaction with the results (e. g., DW's sliders)
  results were saved in file =Random_Molecules_1000_check_rd.dwar=.

  The content was exported into file =Random_Molecules_1000_check_rd.txt=.  From
  branch OpenBabel, script =table_stat.py= was used again to yield a summary,
  file =frequency_list.txt=.

   It is noteworthy that this scrutiny does not support an earlier, perhaps
   rather implicit assumption that InChI by both generators would match each
   other in absence of stereogenic centers and E/Z double bonds.

  #+TBLFM: $4=$2 + $3::$5=($2/$4)*100;%.2f

  In this scrutiny, the ratio of identical InChI strings about "simple
  molecules" (no chiral centre, no E/Z double bond) generated by two generators
  over the total of all molecules submitted is higher than in the earlier run (n
  = 1k).

* Single molecule

  In a pristine instance of DW, one early entry of the set of 1000 molecules
  known to be assinged different InChi by OpenBabel and DataWarrior is entered
  with the sketcher (file =single.dwar=).  It is a compound with one stereogenic
  center only (assigned as /S/) for which DW is again queried to assign an InChi
  (which is
  InChI=1S/C14H12O9/c1-2-6(17)23-13-8-7(4(15)3-5(16)10(8)18)11(19)9(12(13)20)14(21)22/h3,13,15-16,18,20H,2H2,1H3,(H,21,22)/t13-/m1/s1)

  The InChi is copy-pasted into the mask of the Chemical Identity Resolver of
  NIH' Cactus server (https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure). The visual
  representation however plots the enantiomer (explicitly assigned /R/). (URL
  assigned: https://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure/InChI=1S/C14H12O9/c1-2-6(17)23-13-8-7(4(15)3-5(16)10(8)18)11(19)9(12(13)20)14(21)22/h3,13,15-16,18,20H,2H2,1H3,(H,21,22)/t13-/m1/s1/image)
  
     
* Cross-check InChI trust reference

  For the assignment of molecular structures encoded as a =.sdf=, the InChI
  trust distributes the reference implemention for the assignment of InChI and
  InChIKeys as a compiled executable, e.g., for Linux.  Both test sets of 1k and
  5k molecules were submitted to this assignment.

  Lessons learnt:
  + Possibly, the moderator script for RDKit does not identify between well
    enough between double bonds not attached to/included in a cyclic system.
  + Either OpenBabel/RDKit interpret =.sdf= differently, or the SMILES assigned
    by them differs such that DataWarrior's structure codes occasionally change.
    This may, but need not be relevant how DataWarrior perceives the structures
    after importing their SMILES string in comparison to DataWarrior's direct
    import of .sdf files.
  + Assuming the implementation by the InChI trust as reference (1.06, december
    2020), about one in three structures was assigned a different InChI by
    DataWarrior (development version, Mac/Linux, fetched September 7th).  The
    differences drop by about a factor of 10 using OpenBabel (3.1.1, 134 out of
    5k entries with different assigment), and again by a factor of about 50
    using the current version of RDKit (2021.03.5, 2 out of 5k entries with
    different assignment).

* Cross-check with the InChI trust reference, b

  Based on commit =fa3b7a4= on Monday afternoon, 2021-09-20, Thomas Sander
  released a Linux development version of DW correcting most of the problems
  about the assignment of InChI and InChIKeys faced earlier.

  The same sets of 1k and 5k drug-like molecules were submitted to the
  assignment of InChI and InChIKey by DataWarrior.  These were compared against
  the reference executable for Linux, as distributed by the InChI trust (version
  1.06, december 2020).  In comparison to DataWarrior as met on September 7, the
  improvement is substantial; the rate of differences now is about the order of
  magnitude as observed for the analogue comparison between RDKit against the
  InChI trust reference:

  As already recognized by Thomas, the (E)/(Z) configuration of oximes still
  represents a potential pitfall for the assignment of InChI.  This is going to
  be a different case.
